# Sparkify Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data modeling project for Sparkify, a music streaming startup. The goal of the project is to create a database using Apache Cassandra that can efficiently handle the analysis of user activity data on the app, with a focus on understanding which songs are being listened to.

## Project Description

The user activity data for Sparkify is currently stored in a directory of CSV files. The analysis team at Sparkify is interested in understanding what songs users are listening to, but the current data structure makes it difficult to generate the necessary results. The project aims to address this issue by creating a database using Apache Cassandra that can efficiently handle the analysis of this data.
